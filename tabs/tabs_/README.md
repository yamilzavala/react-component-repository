- **Active Tab Indication**: The active tab is visually highlighted for better navigation.
- **Customizable**: You can easily modify the tab titles and descriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For creating the functional component.

## Usage

1. **Tab Interaction**: Click on any tab to see the associated content.

## Customization

You can customize the tabs by modifying the `itemsData` array in the component. Each object in the array should contain a `title` and a `description` field.

Example:
```javascript
const itemsData: ItemsT[] = [
  {
    title: "Custom Item",
    description: "This is a custom description for the item.",
  },
  // Add more items as needed
];
