# Travel Expense Calculation App

This project is a **Travel Expense Calculation** app built with **React**. The app allows users to calculate travel expenses based on a starting point, multiple destinations, and the type of transportation used.

## Features

- **Dynamic Destination List**: Users can add multiple destinations dynamically.
- **Vehicle Selection**: Users can choose the mode of transportation (plane, car, or train).
- **Expense Calculation**: Calculates the total travel expense based on starting point, destinations, and vehicle type.
- **Expense Name Generation**: Automatically generates a descriptive name for the expense based on the route.
- **Submission**: A simple form submission feature that logs the data when submitting.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI components and managing state.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety with custom types for destinations and vehicles.
- **JavaScript Promises**: For simulating asynchronous API calls (e.g., fetching vehicle types, calculating total expenses).

## Usage

1. **Add Starting Point**: Enter a starting point (default: Berlin).
2. **Add Destinations**: You can add multiple destinations by clicking on the `+ Add additional destination` button.
3. **Select Vehicle Type**: Choose a vehicle type (plane, car, or train) from the dropdown list.
4. **Submit Form**: Once the form is completed, submit it to log the data.
